# File Upload Notification System

**Description:**
In this video, we will walk through the process of creating a File Upload Notification System using AWS services. This system will monitor an S3 bucket for new file uploads, trigger a Lambda function to process the uploaded files, send notifications using SNS (Simple Notification Service), and store metadata in an SQS (Simple Queue Service) queue for further processing.

### What You'll Learn:
- **S3 Event Trigger:** How to set up an S3 bucket and configure event notifications for new file uploads.
- **AWS Lambda:** Creating and configuring a Lambda function to handle file processing.
- **SQS (Simple Queue Service):** Setting up an SQS queue to store metadata for further processing.
- **SNS (Simple Notification Service):** Configuring SNS to send notifications when new files are uploaded.
- **Integration of S3 with Other Services:** Best practices for integrating S3 with Lambda, SQS, and SNS to create a seamless workflow.

### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Set Up S3 Bucket:** Create an S3 bucket and configure event notifications to trigger Lambda functions on new file uploads.
2. **Create Lambda Function:** Develop a Lambda function to process the uploaded files. This function can extract metadata, perform transformations, or any required processing.
3. **Configure SNS:** Set up SNS to send notifications about the file uploads. This can be configured to send emails, SMS, or push notifications.
4. **Set Up SQS Queue:** Create an SQS queue to store metadata extracted by the Lambda function. This metadata can be used for further processing or monitoring purposes.
5. **Integration and Testing:** Integrate all the services and perform end-to-end testing to ensure the system works as expected.

### Benefits:
- **Automated Processing:** Automates the file processing workflow, saving time and reducing manual effort.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Get real-time notifications about new file uploads, ensuring timely actions.
- **Scalable and Reliable:** Built on AWS, ensuring scalability and reliability for handling large volumes of files.
